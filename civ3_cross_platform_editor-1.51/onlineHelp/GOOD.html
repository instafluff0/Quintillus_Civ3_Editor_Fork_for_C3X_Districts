                <h3>Phantom Resources Bug</h3>
                <p>In Civ3, if you have more than 32 resources, and resources that are both strategic or luxury resources are
                    a multiple of 32 spaces apart in the resources list, the Phantom Resource Bug will appear.  This will cause
                    resources to appear in a city when they should not.  For details, see the thread at
                    <i>https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/keeping-resources-in-check-no-phantom-resources.391951/</i></p>
                <p>The editor will detect when the Phantom Resource Bug would be triggered, upon saving your .biq file.  It does
                    not yet detect incorrect luxuryicons_small.pcx files as mentioned in the CFC thread.</p>
                <p>You can resolve the Phantom Resources Bug (in version 1.33+) by dragging-and-dropping resources on the GOOD tab such that there
                are no strategic or luxury resources that are a multiple of 32 resources apart from each other.</p>
                <p>The check for the Phantom Resource Bug can be disabled in Options --> Editor Settings.</p>
                <h3>Filters</h3>
                <p>As of version 1.33, the GOOD tab supports filtering the list of resources.  For information on filtering in general, see
                    <a href="filters.html">this page</a>; for information on the filters available for resources, see <a href="goodFilters.html">this page</a>.
