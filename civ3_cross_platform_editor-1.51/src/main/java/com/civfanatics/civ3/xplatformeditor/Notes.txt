***Efficiency***

- It is not worth it to optimize comparisons with StringBuilder instead of
  String + right now.  Even on somewhat complex comparisons they are taking
  1/10th of a second.

- File input: approximately 700 milliseconds as of 0.45 (rev 1 of shared)
  10-12% of that is HDD access; 71% (500 ms) of that is TILE processing on
  a maximally-sized map.

- Multithreading tile processing cut overall time from 703 ms to 578 ms on
  average (17.7%).  Of the 500 ms that was tile processing on Huge World.biq,
  this is a 25% improvement.
