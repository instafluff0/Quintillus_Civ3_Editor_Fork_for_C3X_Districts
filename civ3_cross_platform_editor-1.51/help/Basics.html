		<h2>Basics</h2>
		<p>Upon starting the program, you get a mostly blank window, with three buttons enabled (besides help).</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Open</b> - This is the one you'll almost always want to use.  Click it to open a Civ3 Conquests scenario file</li>
			<li><b>Input From SAV</b> - Create a scenario from a savegame.  See <a href="InputSAV.html">here</a> for more info.</li>
			<li><b>Settings</b> - Lets you change <a href="settings.html">settings</a> ahead of opening a BIQ file.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Other than that, the program will look pretty empty.  <I>Don't panic</I>.  Once you open a BIQ, more stuff will appear.  By not
		showing up right away, the program starts much quicker.</p>
		<p>Once you've opened a BIQ, a number of tabs will appear.  See the <a href="civ3editor.html">index</a> for information on specific tabs.
		You'll also have several more buttons enabled; they are described from links on the index as well.</p>
		<p>In general, to add items, right-click on the list of items, and choose Add.  In a few cases, there are visible "+" buttons to use instead.
		If neither one of these exists, you probably can't add an item - for example, adding terrains is not possible.  You can delete items, where
		possibly, in the same fashion.  You cannot currently rename items.</p>
		<p>The editor will automatically save your file, by default, every 4 minutes, and keep 10 backup copies.  You can change this in the settings.</p>
		<p>Once you've made your desired changes, click the Save button to save your scenario, and then test it in-game!</p>
		<h2>Editor Limitations</h2>
		<p>Currently, the editor only supports BIQ files that:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Are version 12.08 or 12.06 (corresponding to Conquests 1.22)</li>
			<li>Have custom rules</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Additional, opening more than one file is not officially supported, except for the BIQ Compare (BIQC) functionality.  If you wish to
		edit multiple files at once, starting the editor more than once is highly recommended.</p>
		<p>Finally, the editor is still a work in progress.  There are possibilities for improvements, and you're welcome to suggest more at the
		forum thread.  At least one whole functionality area has already been added directly because of this, not counting smaller, easier
		improvements.</p>
