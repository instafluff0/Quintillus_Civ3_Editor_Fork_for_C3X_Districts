		<h2>Scenario Properties</h2>
		<p>The Scenario Properties tab contains a bunch of information relating to various scenario-specific properties.  It is here that you can
		set the scenario title and description, which show up in CivContent</p>
		<p><i>Search Folders</i> is an important item.  This is what Civ uses to find custom art, text files, and so forth for your scenario.
		The order of searching for these items is the order that they are specified in the search folders, followed by the Conquests directory,
		followed by the PTW one, followed by the vanilla ones.  So, if you have an Infantry unit in both the WWII and Napoleonic Europe search
		folders, and you have them listed here as "Napoleonic Europe;WWII", the Napoleonic Europe infantry will be used.  Search Folders should always
		be separated be a semicolon, and "..\" can be used to go up one folder level (using relative paths).  If your scenario folder will 
		be in the Conquests\Scenarios folder, you don't need "..\"; this is mainly for using the Conquests scenario folders that are in
		"..\conquests\WWII in the Pacific", etc.  Note that to use relative paths on a Mac you'll need to use "/" instead of "\".  This should still
		work on Windows (it seems to), but Firaxis's editor doesn't allow it, so try to verify.  The safest route is avoiding "..\" and "../" altogether.</p>
		<p><i>Debug Mode</i> being enabled reveals the entire map to the player, allows editing of AI cities, and allows placing of units in-game.  This can be useful for examining AI behavior</p>
		<p>Barbarian Activity controls how many pesky barbarians there are.  Sedentary means they won't leave their camps.  Anything above
		that results in more and more active barbarians.</p>
		<p><i>Victory Conditions</i> controls the ways in which you can win.  The default is all except Wonder Victory.</p>
		<p></i>Game Rules</i> can change the game considerably.  They include:
		  <ul>
			<li>Civ specific abilities - allows unique units and civilization traits (religious, industrious, etc.)</li>
			<li>Culturally Linked Start - Civilizations in the same culture group are more likely to start nearby</li>
			<li>Respawn AI Players - Defeated AI players start again in an open area of the map if one exists</li>
			<li>Preserve Random Seed - If you save and reload after a losing battle, and fight the same battle again, you'll get the same results.</li>
			<li>Accelerated Production - Makes cities produce stuff and grow in half the time they normally would</li>
			<li>City Elimination - If you lose x cities, you are defeated.  Set the "x" as the City Elimination in Victory Limits.</li>
			<li>Regicide - You have a King, and if your King dies, you are defeated.  You'll want at least one King unit.</li>
			<li>Regicide (all Kings) - You have more than one king, and if all die, you are defeated.</li>
			<li>Victory Point Scoring - This is essentially a new victory condition.  You gain victory points for the items in the
			"Victory Points" area, and if you reach the amount in the "Victory Points" for "Victory Limits", you win.</li>
			<li>Capture the Unit - You are trying to capture other civilizations' units whose "Flag Unit" attribute is checked, and
			bring them back to a victory point which you control.</li>
			<li>Allow Cultural Conversions - Cities can flip to another civilization with greater cultural value.</li>
			<li>Reverse Capture the Flag - You have flag units which you are trying to bring to victory locations on the map (you
			start with the flag and don't have to capture it)</li>
			<li>Allow Scientific Leaders - If chosen, you have a 3% chance of gaining a scientific leader if you are the first to
			discover a technology, or 5% if your civilization is Scientific</li>
		  </ul>
		</p>
		<p>The <i>Locked Alliances</i> section is used for what is suggests.  To move civilizations between alliances, right-click on them, and
		then choose whether you with to remove them from all alliances, or move them to a different alliance.</p>
		<p>The <I>War</I> area configures locked alliances.  Line it up as you would a spreadsheet, and then examine whether the alliances in the
		position you want are at war or peace.  Click on the War/Peace button to change War to Peace and vice versa.  An alliance cannot be at
		war with itself</p>
		<p>For victory type, there are two options.  Individual victory awards victory to the highest-scoring nation.  Coalition will award victory
		to the first alliance to reach the victory conditions, or an individual civilization should they succeed first.  For example, you likely
		want a coalition victory for a WWII scenario, as otherwise you would end up with, for example, a Soviet victory instead of an Allied victory.</p>
		<p>The <I>Time limit</I> in turns is what's used to set a scenario's length.  I don't know what happens if you give it a Minutes limit.
		The MP limits are in seconds, and are used so one player can't pause everything by going out to get sushi.  The turn length is calculated
		by taking each player's number of cities times the per city amount, plus their number of units, plus the base amount, and then taking
		the highest of that sum amongst all players.</p>
		<p>To the right of the time limit, you can control how long each turn lasts in-game.  The "units" of time are set with the "Base unit of
		Time" box at the bottom of the <I>Time</I> area.  For example, if the base unit of time is years, you start in 1000 AD, the first 2
		turns take 10 years, the next 2 take 20 years, and then next 2 take 3 years, your turns will follow the progression 1000, 1010, 1020, 1040,
		1060, 1063, 1066.</p>
		<p>The <I>Plague</I> section does what you expect.  The Earliest Start is used to prevent it from hitting someone on the first turn, if
		you want to be so merciful.  Set it to negative values for BC years.  The duration is how long, on average, plagues last, and strength is
		how powerful they are.  The grace period is the minimum amount of time between plagues.  The Variance is how variable the plagues are
		from the settings you've chosen - with higher variance, it's more likely that plagues will last shorter or longer lengths of time than you
		specify, and be stronger or weaker.</p>
		<p>Reveal Entire Map does the same as what Sateillites do in-game.  It does not remove fog of war.<p>
		<p>Retain Culture on Capture means that cities keep their cultural value and borders when captured, as they do in the Rise of Rome conquest.
		</p>
		<p>The <I>Maximum Eruption Period</I> says that in that many years, every volcano will blow up at least once.  Setting it lower results in 
		increasingly active volcanoes.</p>
