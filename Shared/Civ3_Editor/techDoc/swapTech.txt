Examining Swaps of Techs and Dropdowns
Assuming cmbSource was selected at the start of the swap.

Key:
<-- selected
<-[#] destination (at start of method)
<=[#] destiation (adjusted, aka cmbDest)

Moving from earlier to later
Source = 2, dest = 5, cmbDest = 5

None            None            None                    None
Brnz Work       Brnz Work <-- 1 Brnz Work <-- 1         Brnz Work <-- wrong   
Alphabet <-- 2  Pottery         Pottery                 Pottery
Pottery         Writing         Writing                 Writingy
Writing         Mathematics     Mathematics             Mathematics
Math     <-[5]  Constr    <=[5] Alphabet  <=[5]         Alphabet  <-[5]
Construction    [empty]         Construction            Construction

So our problem is that by removing the selected one, it's no longer
selected and the swap does not occur.

Let's also examine if we swap later to earlier.
Source = 4; dest = (after) 1
Note in our code we bump cmbDest to 2, b/c in Java the API inserts
before the element at the index (our UI uses after).

None            None            None                    None               
Brnz Work <-[1] Brnz Work       Brnz Work               Brnz Work           
Alphabet        Alphabet <=(2)  Writing  <=(2)          Writing  <-- correct
Pottery         Pottery  <-- 3  Alphabet                Alphabet
Writing   <-- 4 Mathematics     Pottery  <-- 4          Pottery    
Mathematics     Construction    Mathematics             Mathematics
Construction    [empty]         Construction            Construction


Verified this with the debugger.  By inserting Writing before the current
selection, the selection increases, so it's still the same index and the
swap occurs.

New idea: If cmbSource was selected at the start, just set it to having
cmbDest (adjusted) selected.  Now in the first case, it will set 4 at the end
and should be correct.
