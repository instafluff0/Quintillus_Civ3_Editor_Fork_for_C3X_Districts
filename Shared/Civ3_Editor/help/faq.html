        <h3>Does the editor support map editing?</h3>
        <br>
         Not yet.  This is currently under development
        <h3>Can I edit BIX or BIC files with the editor</h3>
        <br>
         No.  However, the ability to at least open BIX files (and save them as BIQs) may be added in the future.
