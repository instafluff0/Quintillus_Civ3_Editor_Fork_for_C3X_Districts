		<h2>Input from SAV</h2>
		<p>The editor has some support for inputting BIQ data from a .SAV file (a Conquests
		savegame).  There are some recommendations about this SAV: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>The SAV should be for the latest version of Conquests (it <i>may</i> work with pre-Conquests 1.22).  PTW and Vanilla are not supported.</li>
			<li>Only the retail version of Conquests was tested, though others will probably work.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The SAV may be either compressed or uncompressed.</p>
		<p>Only the custom rules are extracted at this time; custom player and map data is not extracted.</p>
		<p>The primary envisioned use for this is to recover BIQ files for scenarios
		for which you no longer have the original scenario, but do have some old savegames.</p>
		<h3>To Use</h3>
		<p>Simply click the Input From SAV button upon starting the program, and then choose the SAV you want.  Make any modifications you like, and
		then save it as a BIQ.</p>
		<h3>Future Possibilities</h3>
		<p>The capabilities of this functionality could potentially be expanded to allow extracting maps or custom player data.  If you want this
		functionality, please request it in the forum thread - so far little has been heard about this ability.</p>
