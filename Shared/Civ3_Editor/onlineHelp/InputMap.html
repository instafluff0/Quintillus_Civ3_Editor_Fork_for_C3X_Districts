It is lightly tested.</p>		<p>You'll want to be careful to make sure your resources, units, buildings, etc. on the map match up with those in the BIQ.  Unless you		are designing several scenarios with the same rule set, this means that you'll almost certainly want to input only blank maps.  In the future,		support for automatically removing map overlays may be added, but it is <i>not</i> available in the present editor.</p>		<div id="footer"><a href="civ3editor.html">Index</a></div>	</body></html>
