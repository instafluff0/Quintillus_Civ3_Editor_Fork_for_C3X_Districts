		<h2>Input from SAV</h2>
		<p>The editor has some support for inputting BIQ data from a .SAV file (a Conquests
		savegame).  There are some requirements about this SAV: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>The SAV should be for the latest version of Conquests (it <i>may</i> work with pre-Conquests 1.22)</li>
			<li>The SAV should come from the retail version of Conquests - the Steam version may use a slightly different format, and isn't supported</li>
			<li>The outcome of using this functionality on SAVs with custom maps is untested.  It may work, but may well not</li>
		</ul>
                        <p>The SAV may be either compressed or uncompressed</p>
		<p>Although this functionality has been shown to work in at least some cases, please note
		that this functionality is quite lightly tested.  Therefore, it is by no means guaranteed to
		work.  It has only been tested with saves from the Windows retail version of Conquests.</p>
		<p>At this point the primary use for this is envisioned to be recovering BIQ files for scenarios
		for which you no longer have the original scenario, but do have some old savegames.  At some
		point, it could be used to extract an updated map from a scenario for use in a future
		scenario, after some modification in the editor</p>
