		<h2>Zoom</h2>
		<p>By clicking the Zoom button, you can zoom in or out on the Civ map.  Simply enter a number as the zoom percentage, such as 75 for 75% zoom, and
		you'll be at that zoom level!  You can continue to edit the map as you would at 100% zoom.</p>
		<p>The trade-off is that the map is drawn more slowly the further zoomed out you are.  It's generally decent at 50%, but while 25% works fine for seeing the map, I'd recommend zooming in a bit further for editing purposes.  Note that you can optimize this in favor of faster speed or higher quality in <a href="settings.html">settings</a>.</p>
