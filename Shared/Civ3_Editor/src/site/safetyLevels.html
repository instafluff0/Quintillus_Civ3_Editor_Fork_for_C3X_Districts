		<h2>Safety Levels</h2>
		<p>Safety Levels is a new editor concept.  It came about after
		the realization that many of the limits in Civ3ConquestsEdit may
		be artificial rather than technical, and that currently the
		only way to test those limits was with a hex editor.  Safety Levels
		allow the user to choose to either stick with the tried-and-mostly-true
		Firaxis limits, or choose any of several other levels of limitations
		that allow more (or less) flexibility.</p>
		<p>There are six safety levels, which are summarized below in
		order from most strict to least strict:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Total:  This level is equivalent to the default (Firaxis), except
			that is will attempt to catch conditions that are okay with Civ3ConquestsEdit
			that will crash Conquests at some point.  <b>Currently equal to Firaxis</b></li>
			<li>Firaxis:  This level is to be equivalent to what Firaxis's editor allows.
			It  currently is in most areas.</li>
			<li>Safe: This level is to allow values that are known to be safe, either because
			Firaxis's editor allows them, or because they have been tested by
			members of the community.  <b>Currently equal to Firaxis</b></li>
			<li>Exploratory: This level is to allow all values that are not known to cause
			problems, but disallow those known to cause problems.  <b> Currently equal to Minimal</b></li>
			<li>Minimal: This level will protect against invalid string values (e.g. too long of city names), but will
			not protect any numerical values.</li>
			<li>None: This level will allow you to do whatever you want.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Click on the Overall Safety Level: button to modify the safety levels  
		Safety levels are configurable on a per-tab basis.  The safety level
		shown on the main window will be the lowest of the individual safety
		levels chosen, and the background color shown on the main tab will
		be an average of all the safety levels.</p>
		<p>Currently, violations of the current safety level will result in the text
		of the violating field(s) being red, but the violation will exhibit itself
		purely as that warning.  You can still save the file despite violations of
		the safety level.</p>
		<p>Note that levels below Firaxis may render BIQ's not easily
		editable in Civ3ConquestsEdit, and levels below Minimal may render
		BIQ's not readable by any editor (including this one).  It is always a good idea to back up your BIQ files before editing, but
		this is especially true on the lower levels.</p>
