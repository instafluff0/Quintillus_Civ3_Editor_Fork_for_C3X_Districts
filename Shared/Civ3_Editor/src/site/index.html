		<h1>Civ3 Cross-Platform Editor Guide</h1>
		<p>Welcome to the guide to the Civ3 cross platform editor.
		This site serves as the base to the online help system.  For
		questions, please visit the forum thread at <a href="http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=377188">here</a>.</p>
		<h3>System Requirements</h3>
		<p>The only two requirements are a 1024x768 or higher resolution
		monitor (this is also the minimum for Civ3), and a system that
		can support Java 1.5.  Such systems include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Windows 98/ME/2000 or later</li>
			<li>Mac OSX 10.4 (Tiger) or later</li>
			<li>Recent versions of Linux (exact requirement unknown)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>It is recommended that you use <a href="http://java.sun.com">Sun's Java</a> versions.
		Other versions may work, but will not be supported.</p>
		<h3>Setup</h3>
		<p>Once you have downloaded the file from <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/quintilluscfc/ConquestsEditor0.56.zip">here</a>, 
		unzip the .zip file.  Then simply double-click on the .jar file, and the editor will
		start up.  You will be asked to select your Civilization III install folder, so
		that the editor will be able to load images and set your default file open/save
		folder to wherever your default Conquests scenario folder is.  You will only be
		asked to do this the first time you run the program.</p>
		<b>check Mac/Linux issues</b></p>
		<h3>Limitations</h3>
		<p>Currently, the editor only supports BIQ files that:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Are version 12.08 or 12.06 (corresponding to Conquests 1.22)</li>
			<li>Have custom rules</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>Upon starting the editor, you will see a screen that looks
		similar to the following:</p>
		<img src="http://sites.google.com/site/quintilluscfc/files/MainScreen.PNG" alt="Main Screen" />
		<p>The basic functions - Open and Save - are straightforward, as one would
		expect.  However, there are concepts to be expounded upon:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="inputFromSav.html">Input From SAV</a>: The editor includes support from extracting BIQ files from SAV files that have them embedded.  Note the SAV must be uncompressed.</li>
			<li><a href="safetyLevels.html">Safety Level</a>: The editor supports a number of different "safety levels".  A lower safety level enables more elements to be modified, beyond what the classic editor allows.</li>
			<li>BIQC tab:  This tab allows the comparison of multiple BIQ files, automatically and in a format that is (somewhat) easy for humans to read</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Specialized instructions are available for these sections of the editor:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>None</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Gotchas</h3>
		<p>Beyond the requirements and limitations, there are a few
		other potential gotchas.</p>
		<p><b>Opening multiple files:</b> The editor is not guaranteed
		to work properly with multiple files open.  It <i>may</i> work
		correctly, but it is not recommended that you open multiple files
		at once, unless you are using the BIQC functionality, which does
		correctly support multiple files.</p>
		<p><b>Incomplete functionality:</b> Some areas may not include complete functionality.  Details about
		this can be found on the specialized instructions for the respective
		tab.</p>
		<p><b>Red text:</b> Red text indicates that the current value does
		not fall within the safety level's requirements.  For example, if you
		tried to give a unit 21 hit points with the default safety level, you
		would notice that the hit point value (21) was in red text.  The editor does
		not currently enforce the safety level's limits, but the red text
		serves as a warning that you are violating the bounds of the tab's current safety
		level</p>
		<p><b>Invalid values:</b> It is possible to enter too large a value for
		a field for it to be processed - for example, the value 5 billion is
		likely to cause this anywhere.</p>
